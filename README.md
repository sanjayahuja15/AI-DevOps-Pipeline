# **AI-Powered DevOps Pipeline 🚀**
**Automating Security, Scaling, & Deployment with AI**

## **📌 Project Overview**
The **AI-Powered DevOps Pipeline** is an advanced CI/CD pipeline that integrates **machine learning, automated security scanning, and intelligent scaling** to optimize software deployment. This project enables:
- **Automated security scanning** with **Trivy** before deployment.
- **AI-driven auto-scaling** based on CPU usage predictions.
- **Proactive anomaly detection** for failure prevention.
- **Self-healing deployments** with rollback on failure.

🔍 Features
✅ AI-Driven CI/CD Pipeline
Automates build, test, deploy, and rollback processes.
Uses GitHub Actions/Jenkins for CI/CD.
✅ Security Scanning
Trivy scans container images for vulnerabilities before deployment.
Blocks deployment if critical vulnerabilities are found.
✅ AI-Powered Auto-Scaling
Machine Learning (Linear Regression) predicts required replicas.
Uses Kubernetes HPA to dynamically adjust scaling.
✅ Anomaly Detection & Self-Healing
Isolation Forest ML model detects failures before they cause downtime.
Automatic rollback on failure detection.
✅ Monitoring & Alerts
Prometheus & Grafana track system health.
Alerts are sent when CPU spikes or anomalies occur.

📌 Roadmap to AWS Cloud Deployment
We plan to migrate the AI-Powered DevOps Pipeline to AWS Free Tier for scalability and cost optimization. Below is the roadmap for transitioning from a local (Minikube) setup to AWS cloud infrastructure.

🌟 Phase 1: Move to AWS CodePipeline
Migrate GitHub repository to AWS CodeCommit.
Set up AWS CodePipeline + AWS CodeBuild for CI/CD.
🌟 Phase 2: Containerization with Amazon ECS
Push Docker images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
Deploy Flask web application on Amazon ECS with Fargate.
🌟 Phase 3: Automated Security & Monitoring
Enable Amazon Inspector for vulnerability scanning.
Use AWS CloudWatch & AWS X-Ray for logs and monitoring.
🌟 Phase 4: AI-Driven Auto-Scaling on AWS
Replace Kubernetes HPA with AWS Auto Scaling.
Use AWS Lambda for anomaly-based auto-scaling decisions.
🌟 Phase 5: Enhance Security with AWS IAM & WAF
Implement AWS IAM roles for access control.
Protect endpoints with AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF).

## **☁️ AWS Cloud Deployment Mapping**
| **Component**          | **AWS Service**                    | **Purpose**                                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Version Control**    | AWS CodeCommit                     | Stores project source code                          |
| **CI/CD Automation**   | AWS CodePipeline + CodeBuild       | Automates build, test, and deployment               |
| **Container Registry** | Amazon ECR                         | Stores Docker container images                      |
| **Application Deployment** | Amazon ECS (Fargate)           | Manages containerized workloads                     |
| **Networking & Security** | AWS ALB + Route 53 + AWS WAF    | Manages traffic routing & security                  |
| **Database (Optional)** | Amazon RDS                        | Structured data management                          |
| **Monitoring & Logging** | AWS CloudWatch + AWS X-Ray      | Logs application health & traces requests            |
| **Auto-Scaling**       | AWS Auto Scaling + ECS Service Scaling | AI-driven scaling based on demand               |
| **Security Scanning**  | Amazon Inspector + AWS Security Hub | Detects vulnerabilities in container images        |


🎯 Expected Benefits of AWS Migration
✅ Reduced Deployment Time – Faster deployments with AWS CodePipeline.
✅ Enhanced Security – Amazon Inspector & AWS Security Hub will automate security audits.
✅ Improved Monitoring – AWS CloudWatch & X-Ray provide real-time logs and tracing.
✅ AI-Driven Cost Optimization – AWS Auto Scaling dynamically adjusts compute resources.
✅ Higher Availability – Multi-region failover support with AWS Route 53.
